## Description
Node-Red (https://nodered.org) is a Node.JS application and can be installed on a variety of different computers, 
servers and virtual machines.  The Node-Red ACAP packages Node.JS and NPM with Node-Red Modules to be installed in an 
Axis camera.  The primary use case is to simplify adding integration, logic and notification services to the camera.
It is a visual scripting (low-coding) alternative compared to ACAP development that requires embedded C development skills.

Note that Axis cameras are not generic computers so there may be limitations on what you can do with Node-Red in the camera.

## Prerequisites
1. An Axis Camera based on ARMv7hf (ARTPEC-6 & ARTPEC-7)
2. A mounted SD Card in the camera.  Node.JS, NPM and modules are big and camera flash memory is limited.  The SD card is used to store nodes and flows. 

## Limitations
- Installation and importing nodes will NOT work if the camera is behind a proxy.
- Node-Red will consume FLASH and RAM memory.  Different cameras may have different amount of availabel resources.  This means the Node-Red may not work on some models. It may not be possible to combine Node-Red with other ACAP that consumes a lot of RAM or FLASH. Note the Node-Red CPU consumption is limited (depending on the active flows). 
- Some imported 3:rd party nodes may require additional components (e.g. Python) that is not avaialable in the camera firmware.

[See list of compatible cameras](https://github.com/aintegration/acaps/blob/master/Node-Red/files/compatible.md)

- [ARMv7hf](https://github.com/aintegration/acaps/raw/master/Node-Red/files/Node-Red_1_0_0_armv7hf.eap)
- MIPS (Not avaialble)
- AARCH64 (Not avaialble)

## Installation
After installation and starting the ACAP it may take a couple of minutes for Node-Red to be initializied.
If you are not able to access Node-Red with 3-4 minutes, check the system log as the installation may have failed. 


## Security
As Node.JS will have access to the underlying camera platform it is recommeded secure the inerfaces. 
By default, Node-Red does not require any authentication.  You need to add user and password for both the flows view and the dashboard view (if used).
In order to simplify this configuration you can use the example flow "Securing Node-Red".


## Example flows
